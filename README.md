In the third Module of the [Turing Front End program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), our first assignment is to create a React app - any one we like! The learning goals for this learn-as-you-build project include:          
✔️  Build stateful/stateless react components       
✔️  Pass data down, and actions up          
✔️  Understand what a bound function is, and how to make one       
✔️  Destructure props coming into a component       

I decided to build one of the quintessential toys of my childhood, the mystical Magic 8 Ball. Check it out:
