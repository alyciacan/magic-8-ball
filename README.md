In the third Module of the <a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/">Turing School Front-End Program</a>, our first assignment is to create a React app - any one we like! The learning goals for this learn-as-you-build project include:</br> 
</br>   
✔️  Build stateful/stateless react components</br>   
✔️  Pass data down, and actions up</br>    
✔️  Understand what a bound function is, and how to make one</br>   
✔️  Destructure props coming into a component</br>   
</br>   
I decided to build one of the quintessential toys of my childhood, the mystical Magic 8 Ball. This was a great learning experience, and in the typical Turing style, it required a lot of self-study. </br>

<h3>About Me</h3>
I'm a Mod 3 student at the Turing School of Software and Design, which means I've been a dev for 4 months. As I said above, this is my first real React project. </br>
